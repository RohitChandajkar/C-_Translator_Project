# OBJ to STL Converter

This program converts OBJ files into STL format and saves the output into an STL file.

## Description

This assignment deals with converting OBJ files into STL format and storing the output into an STL file. The converter takes the path to the OBJ file as input, converts it into STL format, and saves the resulting STL file. The conversion process involves storing vertex coordinates and triangle data, then performing triangulation to prepare the data for STL format. The program reads the OBJ file provided by the user and stores the data into a triangulation before converting it into the STL file format.

## Usage

1. **Input OBJ File**: Provide the path to the OBJ file you want to convert to STL.

2. **Conversion Process**: The program will convert the OBJ file into STL format.

3. **Output STL File**: The resulting STL file will be saved in the same directory.

## Implementation Details

- **Language and Environment**: Implemented in Visual Studio using C#.
- **Data Storage**: Vertex coordinates and triangle data are stored during the conversion process.
- **Triangulation**: All OBJ file triangle data is processed and prepared for STL format.
- **Input Handling**: The program accepts user-provided OBJ files for conversion.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio
- Knowledge of C# programming language
- Understanding of OBJ and STL file formats
- Familiarity with triangulation algorithms

# STL to OBJ Converter

This program converts STL files into OBJ format and saves the output into an OBJ file.

## Description

This assignment deals with converting STL files into OBJ format and storing the output into an OBJ file. The converter takes the path to the STL file as input, converts it into OBJ format, and saves the resulting OBJ file. The conversion process involves parsing the STL file to extract vertex coordinates and triangle data, then preparing the data for OBJ format. The program reads the STL file provided by the user and processes the data to generate an OBJ file.

## Usage

1. **Input STL File**: Provide the path to the STL file you want to convert to OBJ.

2. **Conversion Process**: The program will convert the STL file into OBJ format.

3. **Output OBJ File**: The resulting OBJ file will be saved in the same directory.

## Implementation Details

- **Language and Environment**: Implemented in Visual Studio using C#.
- **Data Extraction**: Vertex coordinates and triangle data are extracted from the STL file during the conversion process.
- **Format Preparation**: The extracted data is processed and prepared for OBJ format.
- **Input Handling**: The program accepts user-provided STL files for conversion.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio
- Knowledge of C# programming language
- Understanding of STL and OBJ file formats
- Familiarity with file parsing and data manipulation in C#
